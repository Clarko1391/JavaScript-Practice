These projects were all completed using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS in order to better understand how to use Javascript to do basic things like DOM manipulation, simple logical processes and creating simple programs.

All the designs and code in this repos came from various tutorial videos from multiple content creators, specific info can be found in each, individual project.

None of these projects are hosted anywhere but all can be run by cloning the repo and using LiveServer in VSCode to run the index.html files in each directory.
